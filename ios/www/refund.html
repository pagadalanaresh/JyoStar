Please note that if you pre-ordered a rental purchase, your rental period will begin as soon as the title is made available by JyoStar.  <br><br>

                    Sorry for the confusion! A few things may have happened with your purchase:
                    
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>1. Did you choose to “rent” the title? </strong>
                    <br>
                    If so, please check the title’s rental period on its Vimeo On Demand page in case your rental period ended.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    
                    <strong>2. Is it possible that you purchased the film under a different Vimeo account?</strong>
                    <br>
                    In order to access your purchase, you must be logged in to the same Vimeo account you used to purchase the title originally. If you think you need help accessing the account you used to make your purchase, let us know and we can help out.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    
                    <strong>3. The charge may be pending. </strong>
                    <br>
                    If your billing statement doesn’t indicate that the charge went through successfully yet, it’s possible that the charge is still awaiting authorization. In this case, if the charge doesn’t go through successfully, it will eventually clear from your billing statement.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    
                    <strong>4. Your payment method may have failed.</strong>
                    <br>
                    If we aren’t able to charge your payment method successfully, then your purchase won’t go through, and you’ll need to try making the purchase again. If you have questions about the status of your purchase, contact us so we can take a look on our end.

                    Try turning off HD mode by clicking the "HD" icon at the bottom of the player (the HD icon will turn grey when HD is off). With HD turned off, the Vimeo On Demand player will dynamically serve the video at the best resolution your connection speed can handle at any given time. This should improve playback performance.
                    <br><br>
                    If this doesn’t help make playback smoother, make sure you have the latest version of Flash running on your computer.

                    When you opt-in to Receive Updates, you’re allowing the JyoStar of that VOD title to contact you with future updates via email and Vimeo message. You’ll be the first to know about new work, special deals, and any other cool stuff they cook up!JyoStar can choose to offer the titles in as many languages as we want, so the responsibility falls on JyoStar to choose what languages (including captions / subtitles) they offer for their titles.

                    To watch a downloaded VOD title with captions or subtitles, you’ll need to download both the video and the caption files to your computer. You can download both of these files by going to the title’s VOD page, then clicking the Download button. In the window that appears, select the desired video file for download, then select the desired caption file for download. (You can also download these files by hovering over the title in your Libraryand clicking the green download icon.)
                    <br><br>
                    Once you’ve downloaded both files, you’ll need to use them with a media player that supports caption files.

                    We recommend VLC because it is compatible with a wide range of operating systems and file formats. You can download it for free here. 
                    
                    
                    <h5>Once you've installed VLC, follow these steps:</h5>
