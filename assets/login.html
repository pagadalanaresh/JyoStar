                        <p><strong>Membership</strong>
                        </p><p>1. Ongoing Membership. Your JyoStar membership, will continue month-to-month, quarterly, half-yearly, annually unless and until you cancel your membership or we terminate it. You must have Internet access and provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (as such may be updated from time to time, "Payment Method") to use the JyoStar service. We will bill the monthly/ quarterly/half-yearly/annual membership fee to your Payment Method as per your plan you have subscribed to. You must cancel your membership before your next renewal date in order to avoid billing of the next period. It is your responsibility to check the renewal date and request for cancellation if you would like to cancel the subscription.
                        </p><p>2. Differing Memberships. We may offer a number of membership plans, including special promotional plans or memberships with differing conditions and limitations. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered membership plans.
                        
                        </p><p><strong>Billing</strong>
                        </p><p>1.  Recurring Billing. By starting your JyoStar membership and providing or designating a Payment Method, you authorize us to charge you a monthly/quarterly/half-yearly or annual  membership fee (depending on the subscription or rental plan you have chosen) at the then current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the JyoStar service to your Payment Method. You acknowledge that the amount billed each month may vary from month to month for reasons that may include differing amounts due to promotional offers, including gift card redemption and promotional code redemption, and/or changing or adding a plan, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed monthly/quarterly/half-yearly or annual in one or more charges.
                        </p><p>2. Price Changes. We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes to your service will take effect following email notice to you.
                        </p><p>3. Billing Cycle. The membership fee for our service will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your membership and each month/quarter/half-year or annual thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership. We automatically bill your Payment Method each monthly/quarterly/half-yearly or annual on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your JyoStar membership or became a paying member on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your Membership.
                        </p><p>4. No Refunds. PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.
                        </p><p>5. Payment Methods. You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting our website. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, "Cancellation" below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.
                        </p><p>6. Cancellation. You may cancel your JyoStar membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the JyoStar service through the end of your service billing period. WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL-MONTH MEMBERSHIP PERIODS OR UNWATCHED MOVIES OR TV SHOWS OR ANY CONTENTS. To cancel, submit cancellation request in the JyoStar website. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period.

                        </p><p>7. The availability of movies &amp; TV shows or any contents to watch will change from time to time, and from country to country. The quality of the display of the streaming movies &amp; TV shows may vary from computer to computer, and device to device, and may be affected by a variety of factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed of your Internet connection.

The time it takes to begin watching a movie or TV show will vary based on a number of factors, including your location, available bandwidth at the time, the movie or TV show you have selected and the configuration of your JyoStar supported device.
                        </p><p>8. JyoStar streaming service is developed by, or for, JyoStar and is designed to enable streaming of content from JyoStar through JyoStar supported or ready devices. This software may vary by device and medium, and functionalities may also differ between devices. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE FOREGOING TERMS, DO NOT USE OUR SERVICE. WE DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OR OTHERWISE WARRANT THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE DEVICES, INCLUDING THE CONTINUING COMPATIBILITY OF THE DEVICE WITH OUR SERVICE. By using our service, you agree to look solely to the entity that manufactured and/or sold you the device for any issues related to the device and its compatibility with the JyoStar service. If your JyoStar supported device is sold, lost or stolen, please change the password of your account to restrict access to JyoStar service.

You are responsible for updating and maintaining the truth and accuracy of the information you provide to us relating to your account.
                        </p><p>2. You should be mindful of any communication requesting that you submit credit card or other account information.
